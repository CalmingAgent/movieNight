    """GPT recommendation:
A practical “unsupervised stack” for similarity · theme discovery · diversity auditing
Pipeline stage	What you need	Free / OSS option that scales to ≥ 500 K docs	Why it works (unsupervised)
1. Universal sentence embedding	turn every plot, tagline, review, etc. into a dense vector	Alibaba-NLP/gte-base (768 d, MTEB top-tier) or its lighter sibling gte-small (384 d)	GTE is pre-trained with a contrastive objective on billions of text pairs ➜ strong zero-shot semantic similarity 
arxiv.org
2. Fast ANN index	K-NN / similarity search over millions of vectors	FAISS (GPU or CPU), or ScaNN if you’re on GCP-TPUs	Both use product-quantisation; 1 M × 768 vectors fits in < 1 GB compressed
3. Theme discovery	cluster similar plots & auto-label topics	BERTopic + HDBSCAN, fed with the same GTE vectors	BERTopic is 100 % unsupervised: density-based clusters + class-TF-IDF for human-readable “themes”
4. Diversity / fairness measures	how balanced are the clusters & rec-lists?	fairlearn for group-parity + a tiny helper we write ourselves for diversity (Gini, ILD)	no labels needed beyond “protected attribute” (origin, language, gender, …)
5. Re-ranking (optional)	nudge results toward parity after K-NN	simple rule-based xQuAD or Fair-MIND (open-source)	post-processing – keeps core scores intact, fully unsupervised

Why each step helps
Unbiased text space
Modern embedding models (GTE / E5 / BGE) learn from multilingual web + synthetic negatives.
This captures meaning rather than surface popularity (e.g. an indie-film plot and a Marvel plot about “found family” land close together).

Nearest-neighbour ≠ majority vote
Because you search in embedding space, a low-budget Nigerian drama can still be the closest neighbour to a Hollywood film if their themes align; it isn’t drowned out by rating counts.

Density-based clustering for themes
HDBSCAN finds clusters of any shape/size without fixing k. Sparse long-tail films form their own small clusters instead of being forced into the nearest blockbuster group – a first defence against popularity bias.

Group-parity metrics before weighting
You measure how much each origin / language / gender appears per cluster before you build combined scores. This tells you if your signals (IMDb, TMDb, Google Trends) are already skewed.

Weighting by inverse popularity
When you finally compute a combined_score, you can multiply each component by
1 / sqrt(num_votes) (or similar) so that a 95-rating from 300 voters counts more than from 300 000 voters, nudging minority-audience films upward.

embeddings.py – wraps Sentence-Transformers; caches vectors in SQLite or DuckDB.

themes.py – runs BERTopic once a week, stores movie_theme links in DB.

diversity.py – uses fairlearn.MetricFrame for demographic-parity plus a small ILD function (Jaccard distance of genres).

Your existing update_service.py just calls these modules after it has pulled ratings & trend numbers.

Training or fine-tuning (RunPod notes)
Do you need to train at all?
GTE-base already sits in the top-10 on MTEB; most projects skip fine-tuning and jump straight to clustering + evaluation.

If you do fine-tune (e.g. SimCSE-style on your 1 M plot-summary pairs):

GPU: an 8 GB A10 or 12 GB T4 is enough (batch 32, fp16).

Data: create positive pairs via nearest neighbours in BM25; negatives by random-swap – still unsupervised.

Framework: sentence-transformers’s MultipleNegativesRankingLoss works out-of-the-box.

TL;DR
Keep the pipeline unsupervised: universal embeddings → density clustering → metric audit → light re-weighting.
This surfaces themes automatically, lets you measure diversity objectively, and still supports fast similarity search for recommendations – all without labelled data or licence fees."""
