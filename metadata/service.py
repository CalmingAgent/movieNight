#Math calculations, predictions and a facade to call other metadata files (get_meta_(argument))

# - Program calculates probability of us watching a movie (given random titles of the number of
#   people attending equals the upper bound, inclusive)
# - Use density curves for frequency of people coming to movies, 
#   each column would be weighted higher for higher
#   Attendency of movie night
# - Get Standard Deviation of each column to weight each score biased
#   to weight the score further
# - Get Metadata from movies: year, genre, mpaa rating, number of votes on ratings,
#   IMdb, rotten tomatoes, and metacritic rating, trend score
# - Need to disern what model to use, use a residal plot to disern if there is a good fit.
# - Could use R^2 to get the percentage to try to minamize this.
# - Need to compare if the movies are similar, duh? Where was I going with this? 
# Ah, I remember. Need to compare the meta data on the list to see how similar a movie is to the rest on the randomly picked list
# this will tell me how different the movies are from each other. if they are all similar, I would probably need to weight differently or handle
# -would also need to get number of YT view for calculations
#Example Tables:

# -- Movies (one row per film)
# CREATE TABLE movies (
#   id                   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
